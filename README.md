# Google Fonts + 日本語 早期アクセス

As Google makes progress on supporting Japanese web typography, we invite designers and developers to experiment with these Japanese web fonts now available from Google Fonts Early Access.

This repository contains the type specimen site built to showcase the collection.

This project is not an official Google project, and Google provides no support for it.
